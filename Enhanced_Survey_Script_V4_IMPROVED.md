### Optimization Tips

#### Make Benchmark Report Creation Easier:

1. **Automate where possible:**
   - Use Google Sheets/Excel with formulas for calculations
   - Create template with placeholders
   - Use mail merge or simple Python script to generate PDFs

2. **Limit customization scope:**
   - 3-5 key charts (not 20)
   - 2-3 paragraphs of custom text
   - Template recommendations based on response patterns

3. **Batch production:**
   - Generate all reports at once
   - Send in batches every 2 weeks
   - Creates predictable workflow

#### Make Consultations More Efficient:

1. **Group by type:**
   - TCI users in one batch
   - High bad debt companies in another
   - Can share common insights across similar profiles

2. **Record (with permission):**
   - Can review later for insights
   - Don't have to take detailed notes in real-time

3. **Offer group sessions:**
   - "Join a 30-min roundtable with 3-4 other credit managers"
   - More efficient for you
   - Added networking value for them
